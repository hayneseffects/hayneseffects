            <h3><em>I pushed the gain control and ahead of me distortion screamed through the air...</em></h3>
            <p>The Hayes Effects Boost! is a positional boost pedal with a built-in loop. Stack your gain pedals between the loop in and out and, with the tap of a switch, choose whether you boost before or after your loop.</p>
            <!-- <p>The Boost! offers unmatched versatility</p> -->
            <h4>The Boost</h4>
            <p>The MOSFET boost circuit is based on the ZVEX Super Hard On, an ultra-transparent boost that goes from clean to crunch in just a crackle. An LED indicates whether the boost is engaged.</p>
            <h4>The Switch & The Loop</h4>
            <p>The flipper switch enables you to choose where the boost is positioned, before or after any pedals you place in the loop. The position of the boost is indicated by a pair of LEDs.</p>
            <p>Place a drive pedal into the loop and use the flipper switch to boost the volume, or boost into the drive pedal and drive it harder.</p>
