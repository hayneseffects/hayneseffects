            <h1>About Haynes Effects</h1>
            <p>I build versatile pedals designed for guitarists like me, who need to get a large number of tones from a meager travell rig. I hand-build each pedal from my workshop in the South of England.</p>

            <h3>The Boost</h3>
            <p>The MOSFET boost circuit is loosely based on the ZVEX Super Hard On, an ultra-transparent boost that goes from clean to crunch in just a crackle. An LED indicates whether the boost is engaged.</p>

        <div class="6u 12u$(small)" style="padding: 4em">
            <h3>The Switch & The Loop</h3>
            <p>The flipper switch enables you to choose where the boost is positioned, before or after any pedals you place in the loop. The position of the boost is indicated by a pair of LEDs.</p>

            <h3>How To Use This Pedal</h3>
            <p>Place a drive pedal into the loop and use the flipper switch to boost the volume, or boost into the drive pedal and drive it harder.</p>
